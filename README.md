###### Installing VIM

```sh
sudo apt-get install vim vim-common
```

---

###### Now we're in vim!

Type `i` to go into insert mode.

Now you can type normally.

---

###### Saving and Quitting

Hit `esc` to get out of insert mode.

Now type:

```
:w foo.txt
```

to save your file as `foo.txt`.

---

You can go back into insert mode by typing `i` again or you can quit by typing:

```
:q
```

Once you've quit, you can open your file back up again by running:

```
$ vim foo.txt
```

---

or you can do just `vim` and then from command mode do:

```
:o foo.txt
```

If you've opened a file already, you can just type `:w` to save the file, you don't need to type its name every time.
